# Ryanair Demo using Selenium with Java

This project demonstrates a regression testcase using Selenium (booking a standard flight).

It makes use of best practices, such as:
- Page Object Model
- Explicit waitsf
- TestNG

I'm working on including additional fucntionality. However, Ryanair frequently change their UI, so it may become outdated.
I've recorded a video of the testcase, which can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/aCXF4OCsXKw
